1. Consumer Credit Scoring Model (Huntington National Bank)
Tech Used: R, Logistic Regression, WoE/IV, AUC
Summary: Developed a predictive model to classify subprime auto loan risk using logistic regression and Weight of Evidence (WoE) binning.
Impact: Helped simulate default probabilities for nearly 3,000,000 loan applications. Successfully developed a credit score model that outperform the FICO credit score for predicting default on auto loans.

2. Customer Segmentation via PCA + Clustering
Tech Used: R, PCA, k-means, ggplot2
Summary: Reduced dimensionality of socioeconomic data and identified optimal customer groups using PC1 vs PC4 projections.

3. Variable Selection: Stepwise + IV Filtering
Tech Used: R, Stepwise AIC/BIC, Information Value
Summary: Engineered features with WoE and IV metrics, then reduced model dimensionality with forward stepwise regression based on SBC.
